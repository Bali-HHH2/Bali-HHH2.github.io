 <div class="pageheader"><h2><strong>A Guide for Hares</strong></h2></div>
 <div class="body">
    <p><strong>1)</strong> You first need to coordinate with the Hare Raiser to 
      get on the schedule. </p>
    <p><strong>2)</strong> The schedule is usually filled one or more months in advance, so plan 
      ahead to get the date you want. </p>
    <p><strong>3)</strong> A note for virgin (first time) hares: You must have a veteran co-hare! 
      If you don't arrange for a suitably experienced co-hare yourself, the Hare 
      Raiser will help you or appoint one for you</p>
    <p><strong>4)</strong> The first thing you must do is to choose a site from which to start the 
      run. This should be accessible by road for hashers and beer trucks and have 
      adequate parking for 20-40 cars. <strong>You must get permission from the head of the local community to use the site on the day.</strong>
      Hash sites are often 
      close to temples but they should not interfere with activities there; watch 
      out for graveyards and stay away from them, we cannot park on someone’s 
      beloved. Hash Cash has budgeted a small amount for contributions to show 
      our appreciation to the local banjar for their co-operation. While we have 
      a number of well established hash sites that have hosted numerous runs for 
      years, the increase in hash groups and the encroaching 'civilization' means 
      that we must always be looking for new sites. Some prefer low altitude sites; 
      others prefer the more scenic sites up in the hills; that's why we have 
      a different hare every week! Use your judgment and keep in mind the time 
      of year for comfort and safety. Its a good idea to set a run from a Wantilan 
      or other similar structures that offer shelter in the rainy season, so the 
      circle is not washed out and the beer not watered down.</p>
    <p>Make sure to think of the following basic guidelines when setting a run:</p>
    <ul>
	<li>Get permission from the local community to use the site</li>
      <li>Never run through temples or temple courtyards. </li>
      <li>No circles drinking or risque behaviour in front of temple gates. </li>
      <li>Do not set runs through private houses or property (rice fields etc are generally regarded as public access). </li>
      <li>Always ask permission from the local banjar, kepalla desa or kepalla dusun (whoever is the local village head).</li>
      <li>Do not spray paint on roads or other permanent places.</li>
      <li>Use paper and not plastic for setting runs.</li>
      <li>Always be very polite to any local people.</li>
      <li>Check that there are no ceremonies or other activities being held in the area on the day of the run.</li>
      <li>Keep away from graveyards.</li>
      <li>People also need to be careful around any of the multitude of small shrines in rice fields or anywhere else.</li>
      <li>Do not set runs on fragile narrow rice bunds that can be damaged by 200 feet running over them.</li>
      <li>Do not harass and perve on women washing in the rivers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>5)</strong> Supply the hare-raiser or the scribe with a map, showing place names, 
      distances and so on. Keep in mind that not everyone knows Bali as well as 
      you do, and that hashers may be arriving from all directions. The map should 
      be prepared at least 8 days before your run and given to the hare raiser 
      in advance so that it can be posted at the previous weeks hash. This also 
      means, we hopefully will avoid conflict with other hash groups.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>6)</strong> Two or three “reccy's&quot; may be necessary to be sure you know your 
      way around and so you can set two runs, a long run, and a short run. These 
      should not come too close to each other and you should know the area well 
      enough to make last minute changes to avoid raging rivers, broken bridges 
      and sudden ceremonies.The time it takes to walk a run should be about twice 
      the time taken by front runners (i.e a one hour run should take two hours 
      to walk). Runs should not go through private homes /compounds or temples 
      and should avoid fragile bunds particularly when the rice paddies are flooded. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>7)</strong> The week before the run the hare should arrange for co-hares (3 hares 
      are allowed) and paper (shredded or chopped paper is available from any 
      shipper and is sold by the kilo, 2 kilos is sufficient, so buy 5!). You 
      may choose to use flour or chalk as well. White paper, newsprint and flour 
      disappear in a heavy rain. Please avoid using spray paint on asphalt,stone 
      or concrete. We've had over 3 new an 000 runs in Bali; Imagine if they all 
      used paint!! Make your own signs or buy red on white HHH signs available 
      from Hash Boutique. The previous weeks hare is also sometimes a good place 
      to find paper and signs. You may also need signs to indicate the long and 
      short runs.</p>
    <p><strong>8)</strong> On the day of the run the hares (who should abstain from alcohol and 
      sex for a week prior to their run so they will have a clear head) should 
      put up their HHH signs before setting the run. Keep in mind your map, and 
      again, that hashers will be coming from all directions, with little sense 
      of direction. You will need an odd combination of string, tape and staples 
      for this; make sure signs are not likely to be obscured by a parked vehicle, 
      stolen by vandals or bypassed completely. They should be salvaged after 
      the run. Putting up signs as well as laying the paper usually provides pleasant 
      amusement for local layabouts; it is worthwhile to exchange a few smiles 
      and pleasantries to ensure that your handiwork is untouched. </p>
    <p><strong>9)</strong> You should know by now how long it will take you to set the run and 
      have realized that you must set off at the hottest time of day in blistering 
      sun, so you are clever enough to wear a hat and sunscreen, and carry a bottle 
      of water and some money. Not to mention your first aid kit, Swiss Army knife, 
      flare gun and insect repellant, and for those easily lost, your GPS unit..... 
      You’re alone out in the jungle remember.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>10)</strong> There should be paper every 10-15 metres, less if you're following an 
      obvious path, more if there is no trail and you're in heavy foliage. Hashing 
      occurs at the time of day when village streets are watered and swept; keep 
      this in mind if your trail goes through a &quot;kampong&quot;. After 10-20 
      minutes slow down the front runners with some false trails or checks. A 
      false trail can be indicated by a line of paper across the trail, or running 
      out of paper.... you can indicate a check-back with a paper ‘X’ (runners 
      must go back on the paper trail to find the 'true trail’) or a check around 
      ‘O’ (indicating that the real trail may be ahead or behind or off to the 
      side). In all cases the trail must resume within 100 metres from where it 
      left off. A good check may delay front runners 5-10 minutes; slow runners 
      will appear on the scene just as they have found the new trail. Slower runners 
      having to find the new trail by themselves and in the dark will not be seen 
      for weeks, keep this in mind. Conscientious hares and some frontrunners 
      have reset false trails so that slower runners can catch up more easily. 
      Keep in mind that hares are expected to &quot;sweep&quot; the run in search 
      of lost runners so don't be too clever. If you want to be clever – remember 
      to bring a torch !!</p>
    <p><strong>11)</strong> Back at the run site the hares are expected to see that the beer is 
      chilled and the first aid Kit is ready for the runners coming back. Once 
      the circle begins the hare does his down down and takes whatever praise/abuse 
      is appropriate and then takes jugs and makes sure that those in the circle 
      have their down downs.</p>
    <p><strong>12)</strong> The On On following the Hash Run is of course where hash got its name, 
      the Hash House being where everyone ate afterwards. The hare can designate 
      where we will take our &quot;hash&quot; after his run, he may arrange a 
      special evening or simply name a bar. It is best to warn the publican beforehand, 
      attendance is optional.</p>
    <p><strong>13)</strong> If the hare wants to do something special whether it is a T-shirt, 
      food, or a rented boat he must also arrange for sponsorship/payment so that 
      the cost is covered. Hash Cash expects each run to be self-sufficient, although 
      the committee does help with some sponsorship of some of the special runs 
      over the course of the year. </p>
    <p><strong>14)</strong> Don't' use the hash to demonstrate your superb physical fitness. The 
      point of the hash is for both hares and hounds to have fun. As a hound, 
      getting your dick knocked into the dirt simply isn't fun, no matter how 
      amused it the hare is about it all. </p>
    <p><strong>15)</strong> Don't worry about trying to lay the perfect trail - there really isn't 
      such thing. Something unforeseen will normally, generally, usually go wrong. 
      Just try your best and your hash (run) will be a success. Accept your down-down 
      with humility. </p>
    <p>There are infinite variations such as a point to point run, a live hare, 
      a pointless run (quite common), a beach run, a costume run, a ladies run, 
      a a full moon run, a river run, a too long run, a too short run, etc., etc., 
      etc. This is simply a guide to the basics. </p>
    <p><strong>Note : Hare's responsibilities include: <br />
      Dealing with the property owner (both public establishment and private property) 
      in all matters. <br />
      Finding lost people and returning people to the start / run sites.</strong></p>
