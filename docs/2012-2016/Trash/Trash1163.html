<p class="body" align="left">It was that time of year again last Saturday in the grandeur of the Sawa Sawa Warung on Jalan Raya Blakiuh, in the vicinity of Sangeh. Yes indeed labia and genitalia, the AGM had descended upon us again, like a large bird of prey wanting to remove our pudenda and it was time to put up or shut up, shit or get off the pot, etc. I do like to mix a metaphor or three. Dancing Queen called us to attention in his eye wateringly neon orange polystyrene tee shirt and began rambling as if he were launching into a gay joke. It could have been for all I understood of it, but it seemed to be his segue into announcing to the expectant masses that they would be given cake. Just kidding, that actually the AGM had been held already by the committee and that for the next year….wait for it… nothing had changed from last year. So, I&rsquo;m glad I came early for this signal moment. </p>
<p class="body">There was some good news however inasmuch as it had apparently transpired in our absence that Wooden Eye would be sharing Hash Masterly duties with Labia, which would both give Labia a bit of a well-deserved break and mean that Wooden Eye would be back with us namin&rsquo; &lsquo;em, shamin&rsquo; &lsquo;em, tamin&rsquo; &lsquo;em, blamin&rsquo; em, framin&rsquo; &lsquo;em and defamin&rsquo; &lsquo;em as he does so well - wooden he?  Yes, he wood!</p>
<p class="body">Another issue arose about non-drinking Hashers paying Rp30.000 for the run, drinkers Rp 40.000 and being subjected to a voucher system to pay for beers, but there was no mention of who would do the work and oganisation associated with such a proposal, nor if the Bintang boys would be interested in complicating their lives to this or any extent. The atmosphere wasn&rsquo;t exactly electric with enthusiasm for this concept; a showing of hands was called for and it was soundly defeated.</p>
<p class="body"> Personally, I couldn&rsquo;t see much merit in the idea; drinkers currently pay Rp 80.000, non-drinkers pay half that. Nobody is subsidizing anybody. There is a non-drinking Hash called the Cola (?) Hash (sounds about right) so I&rsquo;m told (not that I&rsquo;d ever know, nor go), so if you are a disgruntled non-drinking, non-subsidizing Hasher, go to that one. I&rsquo;m a gruntled drinking Hasher in a running and drinking club, and I&rsquo;m not going anywhere. If Rp 10.000 (around U.S. 90c) a week is a big deal to some, I suggest that &ldquo;some&rdquo; cannot afford the Hash and counsel &ldquo;some&rdquo; not to waste precious resources on such reckless foolishness as Bali HHH2.</p>
<p class="body">Anyhoo, if my memory serves me, there was a run, which Labia announced as being divided by three, and was actually set by the Labial one &lsquo;imself and his co-hare Labia Minora (note: anybody who doesn&rsquo;t speak Bahasa Hash will not understand any part of the previous sentence, sorry). Well, look here, I don&rsquo;t want to bore you with the details of the run mainly because I have reached an age whereby I can&rsquo;t for the life of me remember them. The stand-out moments were running along a cement Jalan in the paddys surrounded by acres of golden and emerald mature rice plants and suddenly realising that there were not one, not two, not three, or four but five magnificent mountains rearing skywards and purple behind us, to both right and left – absolutely, stunningly arresting. The genital lips family gave us a beautiful run, probably run of the month, but let&rsquo;s get to the money shot, as they say in porn movies and Vatican Papal Enclaves.</p>
<p class="body">We were busy descending into a steep (and incredibly scenic valley) on narrow-ish concrete steps, when an Ibu of the wide hipped variety scraped by me scuttling her way to the kampong above and advising the oncoming Hashers that the &ldquo;air&rdquo; below i.e. in the river, was now &ldquo;besar&rdquo;. She didn&rsquo;t seem too obviously inclined to ford it herself being headed in the opposite direction to said body of water. &ldquo;Hmm&rdquo;, I reflected armed with all this intelligence and observation. I&rsquo;ve got a head for these things, you know. The sungai was indeed flowing at quite the respectable clip around rocks strewn with Hash paper and confronted with this scenario, I too felt somewhat inclined not to hurl myself in too immediately.</p>
<p class="body"> Before I could act on these musings, Sex on the Desk had rashly entered the watery fray and was being borne off by the rapids protesting loudly. Bitch on Heat and Skidmark came immediately to the rescue grabbing the unfortunate instructor and wrestling her out of the white water. The theme tune of &ldquo;Indiana Jones&rdquo; swelled all around. &ldquo;Da da da da, da da daaaaaa&rdquo; and a full orchestra appeared on the opposite bank of the river, being conducted by John Williams (not to be confused with the Hash Master of the same name). Steven Spielberg hung from the branch of a banyan tree and shouted &ldquo;cut&rdquo; through a megaphone.</p>
<p class="body"> But it wasn&rsquo;t all over by any means, heroics continued throughout the dying hours of the day starring various square jawed individuals of remarkable fortitude who put their very hash shorts at risk of being washed properly. These consisted mostly of Bitch on Heat and Skidmark. Jangle Balls made a belated effort waiting for Ballderdash, who walked right past him in mid-rapids on legs now twice the length of his would be saviour who struggled to stay upright and afloat. Everybody made it safely across except Slip and Suck who joined the search party looking for herself and didn&rsquo;t get back until the circle was in high hilarity. </p>
<p class="body">Speaking of which, it was also a snorter of a circle in which everybody seemed to make an appearance kicked off by Wooden Eye who deserves a Pulitzer Prize for crowd control and a Nobel Prize for making shit up as he goes. His Honour the Grand Master put in a memorable stint with his slant (ha!) on &ldquo;Me Don&rsquo;t Rike No Blitish Sairor&rdquo;, Chippie again sweetly rendered &ldquo;Bestialty&rsquo;s Best, Boys&rdquo; (&ldquo;fuck a wallaby&rdquo;) and newly installed Song Master Organ Grinder ground out &ldquo;Who Killed Cock Robin&rdquo; with appropriate gesticulations for &ldquo;Cock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Robin&rdquo; and &ldquo;ground out&rdquo; for that matter.</p>
<p class="body">It was all too, too fun-making and went on for a silly amount of time. Thus it was &ldquo;Hi ho silver Xenia away!&rdquo; and off we urinated. Have a shot at the Sembung rifle range next week, on on, and don&rsquo;t forget, jam empat it is not jam empat thirty.</p>

<p class="body">On on.</p>
