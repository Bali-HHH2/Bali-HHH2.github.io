As Longfellow<br />
But it's poetry<br />
<br />
Mary had a little lamb<br />
Its fleece was white as snow<br />
And everywhere that Mary went<br />
That lamb was sure to go<br />
It followed her to school one day<br />
And a big black dog fucked it!<br />
<i>(chorus)</i><br />
<br />
Little Miss Muffett<br />
Sat on a tuffett<br />
Eating her curds and whey<br />
Along came a spider<br />
That sat down beside her<br />
And said, &quot;What's in the bowl, bitch?&quot;<br />
<i>(chorus)</i><br />

Was the pickaxe through its head<br />
<i>(chorus)</i><br />

Went up the hill<br />
Each had a buck and a quarter<br />

Little Boy Blue<br />
Because he needed the money<br />
<i>(chorus)</i><br />
<br />
Little Jack Horner<br />
Sat in the corner<br />
Eating his sister Mary<br />
He stuck in his thumb<br />
And pulled out a plum<br />
And said, &quot;Hey, what happened to the cherry?&quot;<br />
<i>(chorus)</i><br />
<br />
When Mary had a little lamb<br />
The doctor was surprised<br />
But when Old MacDonald had a farm<br />
The doctor nearly died<br />

Humpty Dumpty had a great fall<br />
All the kings horses and all the kings men<br />
Had one fucking big omelette<br />
<i>(chorus)</i><br />
<br />
Mary had a little lamb<br />
Her father shot it dead<br />
She still takes it to school each day<br />
Between two hunks of bread<br />
<i>(chorus)</i><br />
<br />
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick<br />
Jack jumped over the candlestick<br />
And singed his balls<br />
<i>(chorus)</i><br />

And it was always gruntin'<br />
She tied it to a five-bar gate<br />

Went to the cupboard<br />
To fetch her poor dog a bone<br />

<br />
Roses are red<br />
Violets are blue<br />
That's what they tell me<br />
Because I'm blind<br />
<i>(chorus)</i><br />
<br />
Jack was nimble, Jack was quick<br />
But Jill preferred the candlestick!<br />
<i>(chorus)</i><br />
<br />
Mary had a little lamb<br />
She kept it in a bucket<br />
And every time she let it out<br />
Her rottweiler would fuck it<br />
